# New Member Activity

Welcome to SPEAR!

This activity is intented to give you an introduction to the following concepts:

- ROS
- Git and GitHub
- General robotics concepts

ROS (Robot Operating System) is not actually an operating system, but a bunch of libraries and programs that are useful for building robots.
You can read more about ROS [here](https://www.ros.org/about-ros/).
We use ROS for nearly all the software on the rover.

Don't be afraid to ask lots of questions, especially if you get stuck!
Also refer to the "Further Resources" section at the bottom of this page if you want to learn more about a specific skill such as using the terminal.
